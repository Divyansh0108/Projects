Hello folks, this is my first ever project, or you can say a little experiment I did when I started learning java language. 

Game version 1.0:-

Added multiple class files for separate guesser and players.
Player can give the number to the program in order to guess it.

Game version 1.1:-

Added level choices namely, easy, medium, and hard. 
Easy having single-digit guesses.
medium having double-digit guesses.
hard having triple-digit guesses.
Added some code formatting for user readability. 
A little twist, this version allows the system to give you the number to guess, thereby increasing the fun.
